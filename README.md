# Trigger-UiPath-Job-From-Dialogflow
First thing we need to do is to get the Client Id, User key and Tenant Name from Orchestrator, under Manage Orchestrator Services to get the access token.
Make sure to put them in 'data' and 'headers'.
You should also add your tenant name to 'headers1' and 'headers2'. Then you should modify the two requests 'r1' and 'r2' by providing the Organization Id and the Tenanat name. Then do the same for the last request 'r3'.
